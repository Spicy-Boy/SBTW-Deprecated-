V2.0 Feature Ideas:
-Animal hunger and food value tweak, animal taming and behaviors?

-Mining charges fix-4x3x3 radius, drop proper materials
---


Long term TODO: Wood widdling/carving recipes
    > bowls, totems, 
    
Implement more crops
    
Long term TODO: chop logs in half for log slabs and siding

MEGA FEATURES:
-Chunkloading at new spawns/first campfire (or some nifty way to tell if picked a spot to settle down... maybe wet clay???)
-Chunkloader "totem" that can change the HC Spawn Chunkloaded spot once

---
Really Crazy Ideas:
-Make animals startle just by getting too close?
Nah, that's lame.

-Animals automatically run from mobs?
Could be fun, maybe hard to implement.

-rib cooking over campfire has custom animation where it is hanging from each stick like smoking a pig

-smokable pipe!!!!

Mark idea: Twigs snap under foot, making a loud snapping sound that could attract mobs
